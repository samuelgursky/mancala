# Mancala Game

Mancala is a classic two-player turn-based strategy board game. This repository contains a simple implementation of the Mancala game built using React.

## Rules

- The game is played by two players, Player 1 and Player 2, who sit on opposite sides of the board.
- Each player has six pits in front of them, and there is a store (also called Mancala) to their right.
- The pits and the stores are initially filled with a fixed number of stones (usually 4 stones per pit).
- Players take turns to choose a pit on their side and distribute the stones from that pit counterclockwise, one by one, into the pits and their own store.
- If the last stone lands in a player's store, they get an extra turn.
- The game ends when all the pits on one player's side are empty. The player with stones remaining on their side captures those stones, and the player with the most stones in their store wins.
